# ML Regression Bulldozer Price 

A Jupyter notebook that is an example of a machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

## Description

ML Bulldozer Regression is a machine learning project designed to predict the sale price of bulldozers. Utilizing a dataset with historical sales data, this notebook provides a comprehensive walkthrough of applying regression techniques with scikit-learn to create predictive models.

### Key Features:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct an initial exploration to understand the relationships and trends in the data, which can inform feature engineering and model selection.
* Feature Engineering: Enhance the dataset with new features that can potentially improve model accuracy.
* Model Selection: Compare various regression models to find the most effective one for our specific dataset.
* Model Training and Validation: Train the selected model and validate it using appropriate validation techniques to ensure its performance and reliability.
* Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on unknown sale prices and evaluate its real-world applicability.

This project serves as an educational guide for those interested in the practical applications of machine learning in the field of price prediction. The methodologies and techniques used here can be adapted to other regression tasks in different domains.
